# Techdegree-Project-10 Full Stack App with REST API

## Course Database Manager
This Project reads data from a SQL-database. App users can create an account if they don't have already. Users can create new courses on the main page. When the user clicks a course button the app routes to the course page where details about the course can be read. On the course page it is possible to update or delete a course. Updating or deleting a course can only be done by the initial course submitter.
